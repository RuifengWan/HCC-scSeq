# HCC-scSeq
Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity, but tumor immune escape limits NK cell's antitumoral potential. Re-exploring immune checkpoints in NK cells is a potential mechanistic approach to address this immune escape. Therefore, we performed  scRNA-seq analysis to explore the mechanism of immune escape from NK cells.
